                <h4><a name="history">RFI.1.1a College History</a></h4>
                <p>Muhlenberg College is an independent, undergraduate, coeducational institution related to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.  Founded in 1848 to provide a liberal arts education in the Judeo-Christian humanistic tradition, Muhlenberg is committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and excellence.</p>
                <p>The College is located in Allentown, Pennsylvania, approximately 55 miles north of Philadelphia and 90 miles west of New York City.</p>
                <p>As a liberal arts college, Muhlenberg offers programs in the humanities, the natural and social sciences, and in professional areas such as business, education, pre-medical, pre-theological, and pre-law studies.  Flexibility is provided through course options and opportunities for independent study, research and internships, and through a plan for self-designed majors.  The College strives to keep its curriculum vital and current with the rapidly changing intellectual world.  The excellence and integrity of the Muhlenberg program have been recognized by Phi Beta Kappa and by some 13 additional national honorary societies which have established chapters at the College.</p>
                <p>Muhlenberg’s academic program is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the Department of Education of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the New York State Board of Regents.  The College is on the approved list of the American Chemical Society.  It is also a member of the American Council on Education, the Association of American Colleges, the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education, the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education, the College Entrance Examination Board, the Pennsylvania Association of Colleges and Universities, the Associated Independent Colleges and Universities of Pennsylvania, and the National Collegiate Honors Council.</p>
                <p>Significant in the College’s tradition are the historic ties between the College and the Lutheran Church.  The name Muhlenberg College was adopted in 1867 – 19 years after the College was founded in honor of the patriarch of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Henry Melchior Muhlenberg.  The sons of Henry Melchior Muhlenberg made important contributions to the early life of our country.  General John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg wintered at Valley Forge with George Washington; Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg was the first speaker of the United States House of Representatives; and Henry Ernst Muhlenberg was one of the most eminent early American scientists and the first president of Franklin College, now Franklin and Marshall College.
                </p>
                <p>Muhlenberg College also has a vibrant Adult Education program, the Wescoe School.  The Wescoe School provides educational opportunities to approximately 200 adult learners--additionally, it oversees the Muhlenberg Summer Study program.  Through a rolling admissions process, the unit offers traditional liberal arts courses following the traditional college calendar--as well as, courses in an accelerated learning format (5 and 8 week courses), therefore requiring flexibility in scheduling terms and billing.  </p>

                    <a name="generalpurpose">RFI.1.2 Purpose</a>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to provide sufficient information to qualified and interested vendors enabling them to prepare and submit information regarding an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP).  Currently the College uses a best of breed business application strategy and wishes to move to an ERP strategy.  The Student Information System (SIS), Capstone, has been in use at the College more than 30 years.  This system has been the hub of all student data.  We are looking to fortify our business continuity and improve trend forecasting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today's higher education market is getting more competitive with a shrinking market in the United States.  As part of our business continuity plan, the College is looking to invest in foreign students and other diverse markets.  To accomplish this goal, as it relates to an ERP, analytics and forecasting are a primary concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the College needs to reduce time spent on data entry.  Muhlenberg College is going to accomplish this through leveraging the strengths of an ERP.  The College perceives these strengths to be reduced duplication of data entry, improved integration, and end user reporting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason we are going with an RFI vs. a Request for Proposal (RFP) is because we wanted to loosen the rigidity of an RFP to allow for vendors to display their methodology and practices.  Because we are coming from an in-house application that has been fully customized to the business of Muhlenberg College, we want the vendor's solution to highlight the benefits of their proposed business practices and their software that supports those practices.
                </p>
