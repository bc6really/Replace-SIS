                    The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to provide sufficient information to qualified and interested vendors enabling them to prepare and submit a information regarding an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP).  Currently the College uses an best of breed business application strategy and wishes to move to an ERP strategy.

We are looking to fortify our business continuity and improve trend forecasting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today's higher education market is getting more competitive with a shrinking market in the United States.  As part of our business continuity plan, the College is looking to invest in foreign students and other diverse markets.  To accomplish this goal, as it concerns to an ERP, analytics and forecasting are a primary concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the College needs to reduce time spent on data entry.  Muhlenberg College is going to accomplish this through leveraging the strengths of an ERP.  The College perceives these strengths to be reduced duplication of data entry, improved integration, and end user reporting.
