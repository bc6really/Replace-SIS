                    <a name="generalpurpose">RFP.1.2 Purpose</a>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to provide sufficient information to qualified and interested vendors enabling them to prepare and submit information regarding an Student Information System (SIS).  Currently, IIRP uses a custom built solution and is looking to migrate to a more robust SIS.  The SIS, NetStride (currently Sharpe Innovations), has been in use for more than 20 years.  This system has been the hub of all student data.  We are looking to fortify our business continuity and increase our capabilities, minimizing customization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, IIRP needs to reduce time spent on data entry and navigating screens.  International Institute for Restorative Practices is going to accomplish this through leveraging the strengths of the SIS and it's integration and interoperability with Salesforce.  IIRP perceives these strengths to be reduced duplication of data entry, improved integration, and end user reporting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we want to allow for vendors to display their methodology and practices.  Because we are coming from an custom-built application that has been fully customized to the business of International Institute for Restorative Practices, we want the vendor's solution to highlight the benefits of their proposed business practices and their software that supports those practices.
                </p>

International Institute for Restorative Practices will not require vendors to provide hardware as part of any contract resulting from this RFP; however IIRP does expect Vendors to accurately specify the hardware required to operate their solution and provide hardware cost data that will enable IIRP to accurately evaluate the total cost of implementing the proposed solution.  Terms regarding system performance and the vendor's responsibility for the adequacy of the specified hardware configuration will be part of any resulting contract</p>

                <h3><a name="requirements">RFP.6.0 Requirements</a></h3>
                <p>Please review and complete the attached Excel spreadsheets that International Institute for Restorative Practices subject matter experts have determined are critical to the function of IIRP.  Requirements are segmented based the various branches of International Institute for Restorative Practices.  Each functional department therein has completed a list of requirements specific to their department for the acquired system.  International Institute for Restorative Practices expects the vendor to review and address each requirement.  When addressing the requirements, please keep in mind:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the proposed product does not currently provide the functionality, be sure to use the supplied columns to indicate whether International Institute for Restorative Practices can accomplish the need through Configuration, Customization, Additional Module(s) (vendor or 3rd party provided), and whether the functionality appears on the vendor's roadmap for the product</li>
                    <li>If the proposed product does not provide for a specific task/requirement/functionality answers of N/A with an explanation of how other customers have accomplished the need (if known) will suffice</li>
                    <li>Due to the manner in which the list has been developed there may be duplicates (e.g. reporting, security).  If the proposed product provides specific reporting to an area (e.g. Admissions reporting is done this way, Financial reporting is done another) it should be noted, otherwise an answer of 'see answer in requirement xx' will suffice</li>
                    <li>Requirements range from general to specific, please answer accordingly and make use of the comments section when necessary</li>
                    <li>It is fully expected that no system will meet the entire list of requirements, but when possible it's important to provide alternative means to accomplish the necessary task/requirement</li>
                    <li>For questions regarding specific products mentioned, non-industry standard acronyms, etc… please contact International Institute for Restorative Practices</li>
                    <li>A number of these requirements will be addressed/clarified through vendor demos, but it is anticipated that there may be a need for clarification when reviewing the RFP.  For additional clarification, please contact International Institute for Restorative Practices</li>
                    <li>If the proposed application provides no module for an individual department (e.g. Financial), it is acceptable to indicate N/A for the entire section.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please note the additional data fields spreadsheet, this spreadsheet includes fields and data items that are important to the function of IIRP.  The data fields spreadsheet is by no means a comprehensive list of data items.  Email the spreadsheets to John Glasgow along with the RFP no later than [date three]</p>
